# Intro
[Phaser](http://phaser.io/download/stable) is a JavaScript library for making 2D games, the main advantage is that it uses [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) to render graphics, plus it also automatically switches to Canvas API when running on old devices.

## Running a simple web server on your machine using Python 3
From the command line, run:
```bash
$ python -m http.server 8083
```
*Remember to run this command on the folder where the main game code is stored.*

You will need to set up some web server because the browser will not allow file access for security reasons, so using HTTP the web server deliver this files to the browser. Alternatives for simply set up a web server: IntelXDK 3987, Brackets.
